# Flasher Script

This was a small script made to help flash an st discorvery board using openocd.

## Note for users : 

We where having a friendly debate ( it was our pretend disagrement, mostly just for fun )
at the time this was written on the merits of windows versus linux. As such, if you launch the
script you will be greeted with a huge "Linux is better than windows".
